    % Updates a dairy/beef cattle state matrix (i.e. one element of self.dairyCattleStates/

    % Mortality_Rates() and Farm_Square_Model.Compute_Host_Culling_Rates(). This function

    % cattleStateMatrix: A matrix which spans one index (in the third dimension) of a

    % infectionStateChange: A matrix comprising the number of individuals in each
    % compartment in the state matrix who should transition rightwards.
    % ageStateChange: A matrix comprising the number of individuals in each compartment in
    % the state matrix who should transition downwards.
    % mortalityStateChange: A matrix comprising the number of individuals in each
    % compartment in the state matrix who experience disease-associated mortality.
    % cullingStateChange: A matrix comprising the number of indiviudals in each
    % compartment in the state matrix who experience culling.
    % 
    % ageReEntryRow: The index of the "adult" row in the state matrix.
    % femaleBirthsOnly: A bool indicating whether only female births should enter the
    % population structure.
