function [km nmi mi] = haversine(loc1, loc2)
% HAVERSINE     Compute distance between locations using Haversine formula
%   KM = HAVERSINE(LOC1, LOC2) returns the distance KM in km between
%   locations LOC1 and LOC2 using the Haversine formula.  LOC1 and LOC2 are
%   latitude and longitude coordinates that can be expressed as either
%   strings representing degrees, minutes, and seconds (suffixed with
%   N/S/E/W), or numeric arrays representing decimal degrees (where
%   negative indicates West/South).
%
%   [KM, NMI, MI] = HAVERSINE(LOC1, LOC2) returns the computed distance in
%   kilometers (KM), nautical miles (NMI), and miles (MI).
%
%   Examples
%       haversine('53 08 50N, 001 50 58W', '52 12 16N, 000 08 26E') returns
%           170.2547
%       haversine([53.1472 -1.8494], '52 12.16N, 000 08.26E') returns
%           170.2508
%       haversine([53.1472 -1.8494], [52.2044 0.1406]) returns 170.2563
%
%   Inputs
%       LOC must be either a string specifying the location in degrees,
%       minutes and seconds, or a 2-valued numeric array specifying the
%       location in decimal degrees.  If providing a string, the latitude
%       and longitude must be separated by a comma.
%
%       The first element indicates the latitude while the second is the
%       longitude.
%
%   Notes
%       The Haversine formula is used to calculate the great-circle
%       distance between two points, which is the shortest distance over
%       the earth's surface.
